    If this is many, then it will find those that lie within 
    the mosts sensitive images

    1. Is it a galaxy? (as apposed form a large scale halo)
    2. Does it pass the M/L and ellipcitie cut?
    3. Does it have an IMage wihtin the radius oft he halo?

    Key 0 : It has a too low ellipticity or M/L ratio AND it doesnt
        have any multiple image near it. The worst
        1 : It has a okay ellipticity and M/L but has no multiple
        image within its radius
        10: It has a okay ellipticity and M/L and has a multiple
        image within its radius

    This will find the lenses taht are closest to the multiple iamges
    SO the cut will happend

    1. Is it a galaxy? (as apposed form a large scale halo)
    2. Does it pass the M/L and ellipcitie cut?
    3. Is it the closest lens to a multiple iamge?

    So if i add 10 to each constrainable galaxy, ConstrainFlag
    will have the following meaning
    0 : It has a too low ellipticity or M/L ratio AND it doesnt
        have any multiple image near it. The worst
    1 : It has a okay ellipticity and M/L but has no multiple

    10 : It has a okay ellipticity and M/L AND 
         it has a 1 multiple image near it. Good.
    100 : It has a okay ellipticity and M/L AND 
         it has a 2 multiple images near it. Very Good.
    1000 : It has a okay ellipticity and M/L AND 
         it has a 3 multiple image near it. Best.
